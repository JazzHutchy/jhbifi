## Summary
### Problem
Electronics have been a strongly growing market in the last few decades

People need an outlet to buy/sell old and new electronic products. There are outlets such as eBay and Gumtree that can be used, but they cover a wide range of products besides electronics. Small electronics businesses struggle to compete with well the well established oligopolies (e.g. JB HI FI, Harvey Norman).

### Solution
A 2-sided marketplace with similarity to Gumtree as a medium to make purchases and sales of electronic products. It allows those with a special interest in electronics, regular people who are interested and small-time businesses to have a medium to buy and sell electronic goods.

### Target Market
- Electronics enthusiasts
- People who need to buy/sell specific electronic items
- Small-time electronics business owners looking to advertise their goods

## Inspiration
Electronics store templates for inspiration
https://www.templatemonster.com/category/electronics-store-templates/

- There are many electronics products sites that use
- I like the layout for many gaming products websites, I think they look sleek and the general colour schemes appeal to me.

### Possible Brand Name Ideas (decided against them in the end):

Elektrek
Elekdeck
Elec-tree-city (kinda like Gumtree)

- Maybe a God of Thunder/Electricity (thor?)
- Anything do to do with electricity that rhymes with a word similar to store

## Review
### Challenges
- Overestimated my capabilities to get everything I planned out initially implemented
- Getting my ERD correct and making sure I have the right models and the right number of them
- Created some incorrect attributes and had to go through my files and correct them all as I didn't want to restart if I could help it
- Getting photo uploading to work as intended (had to deal with incorrect attributes)
- Messaging system gave me many headaches (and still doesn't quite work as intended)

### Favourite Parts
- The initial planning phase in Figma went very smoothly for the most part
- Bootstrapping everything was the most relaxing part of my assignment, I gained a better understanding of bootstrap from using it in my assignment (such as understanding when to separate bootstrap classes onto appropriate div levels)
