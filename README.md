### Defintion




## Inspiration
Electronics store templates for inspiration (lots use white and black with their colour palette)
https://www.templatemonster.com/category/electronics-store-templates/

- There are many electronics products sites that use 
- I like the layout for many gaming products websites, I think they look sleek and the general colour schemes appeal to me.

## Gems


## Review
### Challenges
- Greatly overestimated my capabilities to get everything I planned out initially implemented
- Getting my ERD correct and making sure I have the right models and the right number of them
- Created some incorrect attributes and had to go through my files and correct them all as I didn't want to restart if I could help it
- Getting photo uploading to work as intended (had to deal with incorrect attributes)
- Messaging system gave me many headaches even though I used a tutorial
- Everything...really

### Favourite Parts
- Bootstrapping everything was the most relaxing part of my assignment, I gained a better understanding of bootstrap from using it in my assignment (such as understanding when to separate bootstrap classes onto appropriate div levels)

### Questions?
